# Paxos
Paxos is a Rust implementation for multi-Paxos protocol without crash failures. The original Paxos was proposed by Leslie Lamport in his landmark paper `Part-time parliament`. The Paxos variant that this repository implements is from the paper called Paxos made moderately complex (PMMC) .

Note that the code in the repo can't handle crash failures yet -> in the context of PMMC, there is no functionality for handling config commands. I may add it later if this repo gets enough attention.

## Execution
Run them with Cargo:
```sh
cargo run 
```



## Directory Structure
* src/
  * main.rs _The main file that sets the environment description._
  * lib.rs _Constructs all the control channels, mpsc and broadcast channels._
  * utils.rs _All the message formats, ballots, pvalues._
  * broadcast_channel.rs _Cosntructs the broadcast channels._
  * client.rs _Constructs the thread for the clients._
  * replica.rs _Constructs the thread for the replicas._
  * leader.rs _Constructs the thread for the leaders._
  * scout.rs _Constructs the thread for the scouts._
  * commander.rs _Constructs the thread for the commanders._
  * acceptor.rs _Constructs the thread for the acceptors._
  
  
  
## Approach I took
Generally, repos don't describe how codebase has been written. In a break from that tradition, this section will describe the approach I took in building this repository. Hopefully, this well serve as a good map for someone else who also wants to build Paxos consensus from scratch.
- Add multiple leaders and one receiver and broadcast channel from receiver to leaders - this channel is just communicating simple u8 messages
- Add multiple replica
- Add client, add broadcast channels from client to replicas, modify replicas so that the replicas broadcast the messages received from the client - these channels are just communicating simple u8 messages
- Add acceptors and communication channels from leaders to acceptors -  these channels are just communicating simple u8 messages
- Write message structs, ordering of ballots
- Add reverse channels - add mpsc channel from replica to client, added broadcast channel from leader to replica
- Add reverse channels - add mpsc channel from acceptors to  leaders
- Update the commands sent by clients
- Change the broadcast channel from client to the replicas - messages will be Request
- Update the replica context
- Change the broadcast channel from leader to the replicas - messages will be P1a, P2a
- Propose added in replica, scout to acceptor broadcast channel added
- Work on acceptorâ€™s message processing -> added processing of both P1a and P2a, added new communication channels
- Add scouts and add dynamic broadcast channels from leader to their respective scouts
- Add commanders and add dynamic broadcast channels from leader to their respective commanders
- Add acceptors and communication channels from scouts/commanders to acceptors
